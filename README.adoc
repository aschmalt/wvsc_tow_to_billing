= WVSC Tow Ticket to Billing Converter

A tool to convert CSV files exported from tow-ticket software into a format suitable for billing input.

== Interface

=== Command Line Interface

The command line interface allows users to convert tow ticket CSV files into billing-ready CSV files for member invoices and vendor bills.

==== Usage

[source,sh]
----
python -m tow_conversion.cli.create_invoices <tow_ticket_csv> [--overwrite]
----

*Arguments:*
- `<tow_ticket_csv>`: Path to the input tow ticket CSV file.

*Options:*
- `--overwrite`: Overwrite output files if they already exist.

*Description:*
This script converts a tow ticket CSV file into two separate CSV files: one for member invoices and one for vendor bills. The output files are named based on the input file, with suffixes `_member_invoice.csv` and `_vendor_bill.csv` respectively, and are saved in the same directory as the input file.

*Examples:*

[source,sh]
----
python create_invoices.py tickets.csv
python create_invoices.py tickets.csv --overwrite
----

=== GUI

The graphical user interface will provide an easy way to select input files and output directories, making the conversion process more user-friendly.

==== Usage

[source,sh]
----
python -m tow_conversion.gui.converter
----
